            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GReat and manifold have the bleſſings and favours of the Lord been to this our part of the Kingdome (loving Countrey-men and Neighbours) ever ſince the beginning of theſe miſeries and diſtractions in the Kingdom. For though the firſt ſpark of this unquenched fire broke out the firſt of all among us; our men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (I think) the firſt that were called to ſtand Brother againſt Brother;<note place="margin">At the Leaguer at <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Hull</hi>
               </note> and we the firſt that ſaw the beginning of miſeries; in the firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uſing Engines of Warre, to Beleaguer; Batter, and Depopulate, our owne Cities and ſtrong Holds: and therefore, had cauſe to feare our troubles would be greater then wee could avoyde; yet it pleaſed God on a ſudden to turn our apparent feare into more joy then we could have expected, by the ſudden diſſolving of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60014:3"/>Army, gathered by our Kingdomes foes, in the pretence of the Kings defence, and releaſing of that place which at that time contained the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſafety to the whole Kingdome; and this was done ſo ſuddenly, that our enemies and cruell diſpoſed ones to Church and State, (of which we had many) had not power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their intents in raiſing more forces accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſires; either to obtaine what they longed for, or to bring into ſubjection thoſe they hated; but even in a moment had all their hopes daſhed, by being called away before they expected; to the great comfort of all bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring good will to Sion.</p>
            <p>After which time, we, for a good ſpace, only heard of warre and miſeries, but were our ſelves free from them, or the feare of them; and ſo might have remained, if thoſe, to whom the Countreys welfare was committed, and in whom truſt was repoſed, had as faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged that which was committed to them, as with eaſe they might have done: but God (who diſpoſeth of all things to his owne glory, and knowes how to extract good from evill) ſeeing our wayes and doings nothing anſwerable to his benefits and favours, made way to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60014:3"/>us a ſharper correction then formerly we had felt; and to this end, (becauſe in what they did they aimed more at their own ends then his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to let us ſee that men truſting to carnal wit or policy, cannot proſper) he gave our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours over to themſelves, to be ſeduced to betray the truſt in them repoſed, and to give our Forts, Strong-holds and Armies, and with them the Countrey, into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ands of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to be uſed and abuſed by them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which traiterous dealings, although they wrought not ſo effectually as was by ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and by them ſought for, yet did they make way for enſuing dangers; for by the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one<note n="*" place="margin">Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough Caſtle.</note> Hold (which ſecured our part of the Countrey) that diviſion which then was ſpred into the moſt parts of the Kingdome, broke in amongſt us, and ſet one part of the Countrey againſt another, in great danger to deſtroy it all.</p>
            <p>And by the traiterous dealing of him *, who had the chiefe command of that party from which we expected ſafety,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> John Hotham</note> our enemies prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and got the upper hands afar, as that they had the Countrey at their pleaſure, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Forces into a little ſtrong Hold, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60014:4"/>alone was left of all their former liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Kingſton upon Hul which was then again Beſieged</note>And here againe begun our miſeries, which for a long time we had put far from us; for then were we left in the hands of mercileſſe miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, whoſe tyrannicall exactions at that time were ſo great, that our miſeries were unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and our woe increaſed to that height, that we knew not which way to take to ſeeke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: our condition was lamentable, for even all hope almoſt of expecting deliverance or ſafety was excluded, and the Sun of Gods favour ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſet upon us, and the Lord ſhewed as if he would not be entreated of us.</p>
            <p>But then againe, when we were in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ebbe of adverſity, when I ſay we had no hope left of recovery, it pleaſed the Lord to rowſe up himſelfe as a Giant new awakened from ſleep, and (even when our enemies thought they'd had all things ſure, and us in their wills) to put power, courage, and magnanimity into the hearts of an handfull, which diſcouraged and bet to repulſe an Army ſeeming invincible; by that meanes raiſing that Siege that had beene ſo enjurious to the whole Countrey,<note place="margin">Raiſing the Siege at Hull.</note> and not only were they at that time bet backe; but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that part of the Countrey was ſo freed, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60014:4"/>no conſtant Army durſt abide in it.</p>
            <p>Here begun the Lord againe to ſhine upon us with the comfortable rayes of his mercy, and to diſpell thoſe clouds of ſorrow which ſo long had over-ſpread our Horizon; ſtill many ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of troubles rained downe upon the borders (as it were) betwixt the parties, for preſently after raiſing the Siege, and a good ſpace after (our Garriſon Souldiers not daring, becauſe of their weake ſtrength, too faſt to inlarge their Quarters) the enemy dared to prey upon the Countrey neer them adjoyning by plunder and taxations; making thoſe parts, to which they did reſort, to live in continuall feare. In which diſtreſſe and feare they continued, untill, by Gods aſſiſtance, our Army gained ſo much ground, and that with ſo good footing, that they wholly chaſed them away, and put them in ſuch feare as that they durſt not come among us; and at length through Gods good kindneſſe towards us, and the care, vigilancy, and courage of that ſmall party, (if they ſhould be compared with the numerous Forces which at that time the enemy had) brought the worke into ſo good maturity, that they cleared the coaſt, and brought them, who formerly had with ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60014:5"/>much audacity triumphed over them and the Countrey) into ſuch ſubjection, that they were forced to betake themſelves to their<note n="*" place="margin">Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough Caſtle.</note> ſtrong Holds, being not able to abide the Field, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and keep their former liberty: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the Countrey begun to enjoy againe its former tranquillity in ſome good meaſure, and at length, through Gods eſpeciall favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and the infaligable endeavours and unmatched valour of thoſe againſt it, that which ſo long had been an occaſion of miſery and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to the whole Countrey, was ſurrendred and yeelded into the hands of our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be kept for the Countreys ſafety.</p>
            <p>Since which time, praiſed be God, we have lived (in compariſon of our neighbours round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us) in peace and tranquillity, without the leaſt feare of danger, not being moleſted or troubled by unruly gueſts, or affrighted by hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Maſſachres, nor diſquieted in our houſes by night or day; not having our houſes ſpoyled, our corn deſtroyed, our horſes or cattle violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from us, or moleſted with any other miſeries that goe along with War; but have all things ſo in peace, as if it were generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in our Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60014:5"/>And nor onely we enjoy this favour, but now, when in many places where the Sword hath played its part, the plague of Peſtilence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, conſuming thoſe the ſword hath left; wee ſtill in theſe parts are freed from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious or infectious diſeaſe; but enjoy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our health, wealth and liberty, in a larger meaſure then any almoſt could expect in theſe troubleſome times into which we are fallen.</p>

Is this the way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy peace? Can we expect to have Gods favour ſhining upon us and doe thus? Nay, let us not deceive our ſelves, this iniquity ſhall not be purged away till we dye, if we thus hold on in our courſes.</p>
            <p>For what though no danger (to our thinking) is neere, ſhall we therefore conclude that wee are free from danger? as if God had no other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60014:6"/>judgements then thoſe we have already felt? or if he had not, he is the ſame God he was, and and therefore as able to bring them back again as he was at the firſt to bring them. Oh Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! let us take heed that wee perſwade not our ſelves of peace, and yet walke according to the imagination of our wicked hearts; for then Gods wrath will flye out againſt us in a fearfull manner; and the greater his favours have been towards us, if we have not made good uſe of them, the greater will his judgements be when they come. And truely, I ſay, wee may juſtly feare that the Lord hath not yet done with us, but that he hath a controverſie ſtill with us, and one way or other will bring upon us ſome fearful jugdement.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, that ſecurity may not too far get into the hearts of men, or other miſeries or judgements come upon this Countrey before it have warning, I have thought good to take a little paines to write, and adventure to divulge this enſuing Treatiſe, wherein you may ſee that the Lord hath more plagues then War to inflict upon rebellious and ſtubborne people; and from that, have laid downe many things which tend to ſtirre up men to repentance, or to

               </gap>de at nothing more then Gods glory, and you my Countrey-mens welfare, ſo with more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe I ſend it abroad, as it is, never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that it will, not onely finde friends, but be kindly accepted of among honeſt-hearted and religious people, for the cenſures or reſpects of Malignants, wicked and godleſſe men, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not.</p>
            <p>But if there ſhall be any, who, in ſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warning by this alarme ſent abroad by me, ſhall let looſe their tongues againſt me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame me with any manner of malicious, idle, or wicked ſpeeches, their words ſhall no further vex me, then that they no more reſpect their owne ſafety, in refuſing warning becauſe given by me; for I have formerly taken notice of,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60014:7"/>and yet doe ſee, <hi>tempora et ingenia hominum ad invidiam proniora, quam ad aequitatem:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have put on a reſolution to undergoe what falſe imputations or ſlanders ſoever ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of me, without grieving or vexing my ſelfe for it.</p>
            <p>But if this ſhall but work that for which I ſend it into the world, it will rejoyce me excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and cauſe me to thinke all my labour not onely well, but happily beſtowed, and I ſhall be further incouraged to goe on in my Studies for the furtherance of my Countreys welfare.</p>
            <p>Accept of it loving Countrey-men, though not as a worke of eloquence and learning; yet as a worke needfull, as the caſe now ſtands with us, and as a worke which in token of my good affection, I dedicate unto you; let it not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, be in vaine unto you, but as God hath hitherto graciouſly wrought for your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from your enemies, and hath been and is ſo favourable unto you, that you enjoy ſuch great tranquillity: ſo likewiſe account it as a favour, that now, when ſecurity poſſeſſeth you, he raiſes up ſtill ſome to put you in minde of watchfulneſſe, and endeavour to anſwer his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60014:8"/>who lookes now to finde and have ſome fruit from you, whom ſo carefully he hath not onely ſuffered to ſtand, but even manur'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: If he finde none, take heed what follows, he hath more judgements then one, and knowes how to make this part that now flouriſheth, an aſtoniſhment and by-word to all the earth.</p>
            <p>But I doubt not, but as God hath hitherto been mercifull unto us, in ſparing us, ſo likewiſe he will open our eyes to behold our ſinnes with repenting hearts for them, and raiſe us up from ſecurity, that ſtill he may delight to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
            <p>That he may be thus mercifull unto us, ſhall be my daily prayer; and to ſtirre men up thus to meet him, ſhall be my conſtant endeavour, leaving the ſucceſſe to God.</p>

               <p>Morever, he doth thus uſe variety of judgements and manner of workings, to comfort his owne people, who, otherwayes, becauſe of many exigences they are brought into, would not know which way to turne themſelves to looke for ſafety: for many times his Church and people are ſo beſet about with enemies and cruell tyrants, that there is not the leaſt hope of deliverance left unto them, to mans thinking, but only that they truſt in the Lord, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is both able and knowes how to deliver them, notwithſtanding of all their foes.

               <p>Now, though this requires a larger Anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> yet let this following, at this time, ſuffice; true it is indeed, that in the time of Reformation in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> dayes, after they had wrought through the miſeries and difficulties which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, in ſetting it forward, and bringing it about (as the malicious ſlanders, and letters which their enemies broached and writ againſt them, to hinder them) after, I ſay, they had over-rowed theſe, which were ſent to try their patience, and faith, &amp;c. the Lord was pleaſed to ſhine upon them in mercy, as to give them a naile in the place,<note place="margin">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60014:27"/>the Kings of Perſia, to give them a reviving to ſet up the houſe of God, and to repaire the deſolations thereof, and ſo forth. But who ever reads there (and underſtands what he reads) may quickly perceive what thoſe men thought of that their peace; ſurely, not that God was ſo bound, or that he had ſo promiſed, or that he would ſo continue that peace, becauſe of the building of the Temple, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which they did intend, as that (how ever they carried themſelves before him) it ſhould continue: I ſay, neither <hi>Ezra</hi> nor <hi>Nehemiah</hi> thought ſo; for <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tells them, that if they ſtill continued in their ſins (as propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sabbath, &amp;c.) notwithſtanding that God had delivered them, to the end, to performe the worke in hand to his glory; yet he would again bring the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that remnant, as he had done formerly upon their fathers.<note place="margin">

               <p>The like ought we to thinke of this our Peace which we now enjoy, not that God is ſo bound to continue it, or that he will ſo continue it, meerely becauſe of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except withall, we reforme our wayes, and doe better then our fore fathers have done; may we ſteale and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, and ſerve, and ſweare by other Gods, and prophane the Sabbath, &amp;c. and ſay, we are delivered to do theſe things? or thinke becauſe we ſtand for, and pretend the Reformation of abuſes in Church and State, that therefore we may doe any thing, and yet God not puniſh us? let no ſuch vaine thoughts deceive us, if we doe thoſe things that others have provoked God againſt them by, we muſt expect to feele what they have felt:<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, becauſe wee doe not ſeparate our ſelves (or them from us) from that curſed brood of Babylon, from Papiſts, and from popiſhly affected perſons, but ſtill have communion with them, and are familiar with them, and delight in them and their abominable Idolatries and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, becauſe of this, we may juſtly feare wrath, for the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Come out of Babylon my people,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, (for I would be briefe) our deep ſecurity, and putting far from us the evill day, and living ſo as if there were not (nor yet like to be) any trouble in the Kingdom, we<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe things of themſelves are not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but only as they are ſignes of deep ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                  </note> marry, and give in marriage, we eat and drink, we build and plant, we thinke of no danger, nor feare any trouble, and this is even an infallible token of ſome judgement not far off. Thus they were doing in the old world when the floud came, and ſwept them all away, they thought the leaſt of it when it came; thus were the people of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> a ſecure people, they fear'd nothing, untill they were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the edge of the Sword. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That when men ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then ſhall ſudden deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction come on them, as upon a woman intravell, and they ſhall not eſcape:</hi> their puniſhment ſhall be ſo certaine, as nothing can be more certaine, for ſo the Greek pliraſe<note n="*" place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina negatio fortius negat.</note> imports. Now let us looke upon our ſelves, and conſider whether or no we be not ſecure, and conſequently, may not looke for ſome other miſeries, more then as yet we have felt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may feare more plagues will be upon us, becauſe we ſo little regard our brethrens calamities, nor
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60014:33"/>take no more warning by their miſeries; they are afflicted to give us warning, but we will not be warned, but rather judge uncharitably of them, becauſe of their afflictions; and flatter our ſelves, thinking we are in an happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe of our long peace; now ſuch people God will not ſpare, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Thinke ye</hi> (ſaith he to the Jewes) <hi>that thoſe whoſe bloud</hi> Pilate <hi>mingled with their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or thoſe upon whom the Tower at Silve fell,</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, it is a fearefull ſigne of ſome judgement neere approaching, when a Kingdome, County, or City, hath been bleſſed by God, exceedingly and extraordinarily, both by Temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings; ſo that he expects to finde at leaſt ſome fruit on it, and from it, and yet findes none; and then againe, doth yet more abundantly bleſſe with all manner of bleſſings that place: and yet for all that can finde no fruit to his liking, I ſay, that this is an evident token of ſome deſtroying judgement not far off.

                  <hi>and from whom they would;</hi> but what followed this braving domineering covetouſneſſe of his? preſently hee was brought low, and was forced to crouch for his life to him, whom formerly he had ſo ſcornefully uſed. The like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the Ammonite, who, in a proud manner,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 11.2, 11. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.17 18, 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> domineered over the men of Jabeſh-Gilead, and of the Philiſtims, for their ſpoyling Iſrael in ſuch a boaſting and lordly manner.</p>
               <p>And in the height of their bravery, that Army, which falſly beares the name of the Kings, and thoſe of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were thus domineeringly proud and covetous over, and of the eſtates, and perſons, of thoſe whom they had in their powers. Who knowes not, that in the time of the Siege of <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> we in thoſe parts, were, (for that) in <hi>Ahabs</hi> condition, and they as proud and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and <hi>Benhadab?</hi> all we had was theirs, what they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60014:34"/>would command, we were forced to grant, and not onely ſo, but they came into our houſes, and tooke what they liked without leave, but ſhortly (their pride being at the height) they were caſt downe, to their ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples are for our learning, and happy are they that can take warning by other mens harmes; let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, take heed we doe not after this manner, leaſt we feele, as they have felt, in ſome ſort or other, but if elſe ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a manner be found among us, let us feare. I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the pride, ſecurity, and ſinfulneſſe of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they are not to be excus'd, their faults are great, and worſe they are made, by caſting out honeſt, civill; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, and entertaining deceitfull, deboyſt, and prophane perſons; they are full of <hi>Achans,</hi> of drunkards, of what not? the ſcarceſt of good men: We heare daily their boaſting of ſtrength, of victories obtained, without thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God who gave them; they are full of pride, and vaine ſecurity, and therefore what followed <hi>Benadabs</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, the like we may feare;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.16 <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.30.</note> remember <hi>Siſera</hi> who was deviding the ſpoyle before he got the victory, if there be ſuch in our Armies, (as I fear one by a ſlender ſearch might finde many) it prognoſticates no good.</p>
               <p>Other ſymptomes there are, which might be named, which betoken wrath in ſome ſort againſt us, becauſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, where they have appeared, ſome judgements have ſpeedily followed; but theſe already named at this time ſhall ſuffice, and let them be noted ſo, that we either by repentance take them away, that they be not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, or elſe by preparation and patience, we provide to undergoe what ever they may foreſhew, or follow after them; what that may be, (I ſay) I know not, nor how ſoon or how long it may be, I know not, that time that may ſeem long to us, is but ſhort to God, and therefore, perhaps, when we little thinke of any harme approaching, then
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60014:34"/>will ſuch bee upon us, as wee cannot eſcape.</p>
               <p>But if God doth ſpare us, and ſtill ſuffer us to enjoy peace and proſperity, notwithſtanding, that theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſignes doe ſhow, or ſeeme to ſhow to the contrary; let us not for that grow proud, but with Niniveh, ſet us repent at the hearing or ſeeing the ſignes of wrath.

Now therefore, that the loſſe of any thing may not cauſe too much griefe, let men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apoſtles exhortation, who adviſes them to uſe the <hi>world as though they uſed it not;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29.</note> to ſet no more love or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon any thing they enjoy, then onely for preſent uſe.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, if men would be armed to ſuffer, let them conſider that nothing is or will be inflicted upon them, but what others have ſuffered or do now ſuffer; and it is alwayes a great comfort to have companions in adverſity, to ſee others in the ſame condition that they are in (for no eſtate almoſt would be accounted miſerable, but that it is compared with others, ſeeming more happy) now if war ſhould come againe upon us in theſe parts, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the miſery of war to be raging in every part of the Kingdome, why ſhould we repine to be companions with our brethren in ſuch ſufferings, ſeeing no temptation takes hold on us which is not common to others? if we onely ſhould feele the miſery of war, it would ſeeme more grievous, but when we conſider how others more holy then we, as <hi>David, Hezekiah, Jeremiah, Baruch,</hi> &amp;c. and now many in our owne Kingdome have, and doe undergo heavy puniſhments by war, it is not for us to murmure, but patiently to prepare againſt it; for when the wrath of the Lord is againſt all,<note place="margin">

               <p>Fifthly, or a fifth meanes to be uſed to prepare againſt war, is, to lay aſide ſecurity, and exerciſe our ſelves in uſing the meanes appointed by God for our ſafety; I hold it no diſcretion in time of peace to caſt away our weapons, and unarme our ſelves, and ſo leave our ſelves naked and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend our eſtates, wives, &amp;c. or offend our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies if occaſion be: I am ſure, God that hath provided meanes, workes not without meanes, and if we neglect or deſpiſe them, in danger he will not ſave us. <hi>David</hi> would have the children of <hi>Judah</hi> taught the uſe of the bow,<note place="margin">A.

                  </note> as one obſervers, in the midſt of ſorrow and mourning, hee forgat not what was uſefull for the common-wealth; ſo we in the midſt of our tranquility, let us not forget our own ſafety, to uſe meanes to prevent dangers which may enſue. A place or people ready prepared for war, are the likelieſt the longeſt to live in peace, for where the leaſt advantage can be eſpied, there the enemy will have the leaſt minde to make an aſſault;<note place="margin">

               <p>But I hope that this will not be forgot, and therefore I need not ſtand to preſſe the performance of it much, onely let this caveat take place, that with the Jewes we build not the wall, &amp;c. and neglect to ſeeke for help from the Lord. <hi>See Iſa.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>But againe, if it ſhall be ſo that we againe no more feele the judgement of War, it may be that God will ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us a devouring ſickneſſe, as the plague of Peſtilence, ſevers, &amp;c. to prepare to ſuffer them, let us alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (as I ſaid before) to make peace with God, that

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60014:47"/>even ſo, when wee are once aſſuredly perſwaded of Gods care over us for our welfare, we will then be ready to doe what he would have us to doe, or ſuffer what hee would have us to ſuffer, although it ſeeme ſomewhat hard and painfull: there is yet in man a kinde of a deſire to ſeek for, and follow that which his judgement informes him may tend to his good or happineſſe, which if it be inlightned by Cods Spirit, and directed to ſeek God as the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the chiefeſt Good, then with a following delight, relying upon him, and rejoycing in him; what ever hee commands, how harſh ſoever it may ſeeme to others, or to his own fleſh and bloud, that with pleaſure he performs, &amp; without murmuring ſuffers,<note place="margin">See Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams example Gen <hi>22.2, 3.</hi> Of Moſes, Neh. <hi>11.25.</hi> Of Paul, Acts <hi>21 13.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe he is perſwaded, there is nothing commanded or inflicted, which proceeds not from love, and conſequently may one way or other tend to his happineſſe.</p>
               <p>When on the contrary, being not directed aright, he ſets his love on other objects, as wealth, honour, &amp;c. and hath a ſetled perſwaſion that they are the chiefeſt good, then, having his delight upon them, and his deſires alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether longing after them, there is nothing which he will not willingly performe to enjoy them; and he meets not with the leaſt oppoſition or diſturbance in following theſe his delights, but it ſeemes a burthen intolerable, a miſery ſufficient, &amp;c. ſo that inſtead of preparing to undergoe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with patience, he is (through his immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſuch things) ſtirred up to murmure, and repine, and grieve, and ſo is dejected and caſt down, as a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of his chiefeſt delights.</p>
               <p>To prevent this, let every one endeavour to take his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions from beauty, &amp;c. which ſickneſſe may ſpoile, let it not be accounted as a thing worthy the name of Good, that ſo we may not have any thing on which our delights are placed, that any ſickneſſe may bereave us of, which will make us not fearfull to ſee any ſuch affliction approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: as for example, if two men ſhould dwell in one
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60014:47"/>place, the one hath much treaſure in another place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto an enemy is approaching, with hopes of entrance; the other he hath nothing there to care for, the man that hath the treaſure will be fearfull, and carefull, and deſirous of the enemies returne; when the other feares not, nor cares not what comes. Even thus it is with men whoſe delights are in friends, beauty, &amp;c. and thoſe whoſe affections are placed upon no ſuch inferiour objects, if any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which may endanger the loſſe of them, how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with what griefe that is thought upon? and no marvell, for in looſing them, they looſe their chiefe delights, when men, I ſay, not delighted in ſuch things, can with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, without fear or griefe, thinke of, and ſee ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions come, nay, and behold theſe inferiour delights taken from them (by ſuch troubles) without murmuring, becauſe their delights are above, where no earthly trouble can touch them; therefore, I ſay, this conſidered, let us all endeavour to diſingage our ſelves from the love of theſe earthly delights, which ſickneſſe may bereave us of, then we ſhall not feare although it come, nay, it will make us prepare againſt it come, and rejoyce to beare it.</p>
               <p>Or if the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to ſend a famine among us (as who knowes for all our preſent plenty but he may) that we may be prepared to ſuffer patiently, let us now in the time of plenty, uſe moderately, and with an holy ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods creatures; let us not eat and drink too exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, or uſe our ſelves to needleſſe variety; for if we would thus by degrees be taught to be content with a little, if forced want ſhould come, it would with more eaſe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone; for want alwayes goes the hardeſt with thoſe who have been accuſtomed to variety; one brought up from a youth in hardſhip, will not hunch at any thing, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe all with patience; when as a man brought up deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, will with a great deale of griefe and trouble, labour under any hard burthen. And thus it would be with men and women, who pamper their bodies, and feed their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60014:48"/>with all manner of delightfull viands the want of ſuch would goe hard with them in a time of ſcarcity, when as men who accuſtome themſelves to moderation and temperance, would as well be content with a diſh of herbs as a ſtalled oxe,<note place="margin">

               <p>All that I aime at and deſire, is, that this may ſtir up all ſorts of men to feare the Lords ſacred Majeſty, who is ſo ſtored with variety of Judgements; and therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, let me exhort all eſtates and degrees to <hi>ſtand in awe and ſin not, to kiſſe the Son leaſt he be angry, and ſo they periſh from the right way:</hi> to break off their ſins by repentance, and iniquity by mercy: that there may be an healing of their errours, and that Gods wrath may be taken away, and no other miſery be ſent to worke deſolation in the Kingdome; for be they well aſſured, that though this judgement of War, (under which the Land now groanes,) ſhould be taken away, yet, while the ſame or ſuch like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations remaine (for which formerly the Land was puniſhed) they cannot expect peace or freedome from all afflictions.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, Firſt, let me exhort all thoſe who beare good will and affections towards the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Cauſe, that they beware of pride, ſecurity, vaine glory, and preſumption, becauſe their Party proſpers; let them take heed of living in ſin, be it what it will, and yet think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe, becauſe their preſent foes goe to wrack, for the ſame God that gives them victory over their enemies, can and will doe the like to them, if by their wayes they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him; or plagne them with ſome other judgements, as fierce and fearfull; let the conſideration of this move

And let them not rejoyce with carnall joy, I meane, not onely becauſe they have liberty to enjoy their eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. but let the chiefe cauſe of their joy be, in that God hath wrought for his owne glory, and peoples deliverance; and withall, humbly and willingly confeſſe, that God might as juſtly have given them into the hands of their enemies, to have been in ſubjection under them, as he hath given them into their hands, and under their ſubjection and, becauſe all things are at his diſpoſing, humbly let them deſire of him to perfect this begun work, and to keep in ſubjection thoſe that doe oppoſe Reformation, and to divert thoſe plagues which by their manifold failings, by reſpects, and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Next, let me intreat all Souldiers, and thoſe that are imployed in fighting the battels of the Lord, both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and others, that they forget not to aſcribe the glory of their many worthy victories to the Lord, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth their hands to War,<note place="margin">

               <p>Let them therefore not be high-minded but feare, and behave themſelves as Souldiers, under the banner of Jeſus Chriſt, blameleſſe, without offence, that their civill and upright dealing may win love where ever they goe; and ſo may honour their profeſſion and Cauſe they ſtand for, that none may have any juſt occaſion to taxe them for any thing amiſſe.</p>

Oh therefore, prepare to ſuffer, and doe the worke of the Lord with diligence, that how ever iniquity may abound, and the love of many waxe cold, yet you may be zealous for Gods glory, and carefull to ſave thoſe ſoules to you committed; and likewiſe by your examples, may ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then others to undergoe with you, all manner of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of what kinde or quality ſoever they be of; take heed that ſecurity poſſeſſe not you, for if the watchmen fall aſleep, the city is in danger of the enemies ſurpriſall: be

            <p>HAving long ſince finiſhed the foregoing Treatiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred by ſome occaſions from publiſhing of it then: now (ſince I brought it to the Preſſe) it pleas'd God to diſpoſe of our Affaires in theſe Northerne parts, that Feares have taken hold of many; that which I, in the foregoing Treatiſe give warning of, that in ſome ſort, ſeemes to be approaching.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, ſeeing I have begun to give warning, although I have neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For my part, as I never did, ſo now I doe not much fear the Diſloyalty of our Brethren; but yet what God may do by them for the correction of us for ſin, I know not: our abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations may ſo far incenſe him againſt us, that he may make our deareſt and moſt faithfull friends, our deadly

            <p>God hath been pleas'd to make way to bring in many bleſſings (by their meanes) to this Nation, and likewiſe to correct many in theſe parts ſeverely by them, they being as a two-edged ſword, have cut both wayes, deſtroying our enemies and correcting our friends; if wee have but thankful hearts for the bleſſings we have received by them, and with all take warning by thoſe ſufferings we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60014:57"/>by their being among us, we need not feare bu all will be well: that God will perfect the begun work, and ſettle us in peace to our everlaſting joy. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if wee either aſcribe the honour due to God to them, or murmure for thoſe corrections which have been ſent upon us; or forget them, and grow proud, and ſecure, now they are over, we may by theſe doings, greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lords wrath againſt us, even perhaps to make them Inſtruments to conſume (at the leaſt ſharply to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect) us.</p>
            <p>We and they are entred into a Solemne League and Covenant, binding our ſelves one to another, as much as lies in us, not onely to continue but to increaſe brotherly love and amity betwixt the Nations; this Covenant is no triviall thing, ſeeing it was taken ſo ſolemnely before the Lord of heaven and earth; whom we call'd to witneſſe, with our hearts, our reall intentions herein. Let us take heede that in buſineſſes of ſuch weight we mocke not God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leaſt we breake it upon any pretence what ever; for if it were contrary to Gods Word, or needleſſe, why were we ſo bold as to attempt it? if it were, and be agreeable to the Word of God, how dare we neglect it? or how dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinke it a piece of piety not to take it? as too many doe: yet indeed, better it is not to take it,<note place="margin">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60014:58"/>us? Oh therefore, if ever we deſire to ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes continue In a firme and irrefragable unity, let us both repent unfainedly, and that ſpeedily of our breach of Covenant: and likewiſe for the time to come, endeavour to be more carefull, and more zealous to keep it, then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have been.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes the bitter, malicious, and wicked taunts of our bloud-thirſty enemies, ſhould be ſufficient to cauſe us to beware how we doe any thing, which in the leaſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may tend to breake this unity; doe we not yet ſee, how by the occaſion onely of theſe ſuppoſed feares, which ſcarcely can be ſaid to be reall jealouſies, they ſeem to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, and in a ſcoffing manner can ſay, <hi>See now the truſtineſſe of your Brethren in whom you put ſo much confidences &amp;c.</hi> Oh! what cauſe of rejoycing would it be to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Truth, to ſee the knot of amity broken betwixt us? how ardently they long after it, what baſe, wicked, and untrue ſlanders are raiſed (if it be poſſible) to effect it; the Divell &amp; all his inſtruments beſtir themſelves to bring it to paſſe, it is now their maine deſigne, yea, of both the open enemy and the ſecret, Papiſt and Schiſmatick; for, if the unity hold, they know there is ſmall hope for them to prevaile; there is no better way to keep it undiſſolvable, then to keep our ſelves cloſe to God, by walking in the pathes of his Commandements; our breaking with him will cauſe him breake in pieces our greateſt hopes, and give us over to become a ſhame and reproach to them, who would much rejoyce to behold it.</p>
            <p>But that they may never ſee their deſires, let us uſe all good meanes to continue and increaſe the love and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſſe already begun; to this end, let us begin to betake our ſelves to ſome ſetled courſe in Religion, and be not alwayes like children, carried about with every blaſt of vaine Doctrine.<note place="margin">

            <p>Moreover, if we were once ſetled, this would give ſome ſatisfaction to our Brethren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who no doubt, but heartily deſire to ſee the Kingdomes, as they are happily united under one King, ſo to be as neere (as conveniently they may) of one Religion, and grieve to behold the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Kingdomes ſo pitifully dilacerated by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing diviſions, when both they and we have ſworne to do our endeavours to unite them: I know the obſtructions

            <p>And were it any diſcredit for us to follow them as far as they followed the Word of God? many ſay, Why ſhould the <hi>Scots</hi> be our Teachers? why ſhould we imitate them in their actions, and order our Church according to theirs, &amp;c. To theſe I anſwer, why did not we, who have alwayes been accounted a Learned Nation, and have ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed peace and proſperity in a large manner begin the work, that they might have followed us; but ſuffer them (a poore dejected, and deſpiſed people) to begin the worke; and not only ſo, but through our backwardneſſe, hollow-heartedneſſe, and cowardlineſſe; be forced to ſtand neede of their help to aide us in it? If there be any diſcredit, it is in that; but to follow them (as far as they goe in a right way) is no diſcredit, except it be a ſhame to doe well. We may remember that it hath been to our coſt, that we have been ſo backward in the work; they led the way, but it was in our Borders; they managed the Field, but it was our loſſe that got the victory; they call'd for the Reckoning, but we paid the ſhot: ſhall we blame them or deſpiſe them for this? Nay, let us blame our ſelves, and our owne ſins which provoked God thus to debaſe us, and moved him to make uſe of them to begin, and goe forward with his work, who were lightly eſteemed of in the world, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no better then a baſe and barbarous people before? this is not unuſuall with the Lord, to imploy the weake things of the world,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>to confound the things that are mighty; to caſt down the proud, and exalt the humble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are a proud and haughty Nation, and therefore, God hath ſet them above us whom we deſpiſed, and given them the honour, and made us bear the burthen; yea, even cauſed us to ſuſtaine them in the worke, and to pay them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60014:59"/>the charges they were at in bringing it forward: yea, now. God hath made them the head and we the taile, they have the honour of this great worke, and we muſt now follow them, if we, as they have done, attaine to peace.</p>
            <p>Nay, and if we murmure at this, and grow proud, and ſcorne yet to be tractable or forward to goe on with the work of Reformation, &amp;c. we may juſtly feare that for our ſins God will more humble us, and exalt them, and cauſe them ſtill more to gain by our loſſes, untill they be as weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and famous as we have been, and we as deſpiſed as they were.</p>
            <p>It is not the way to gaine peace, to murmure at Gods dealings with us, or to deſpiſe thoſe whom formerly wee have ſtood need of; let us ſubmit our ſelves to God; we may ſee, by Gods dealings with us, that he as yet is diſpleaſed with us; we are not yet ſufficiently humbled for other ſins, more eſpecially for this backwardneſſe to Reformation, for we, ſome of us account it as a good and holy act to ſtand as men yet having their Religion to chuſe; we are yet lukewarme and careleſſe, and therefore may juſtly feare God hath yet a ſcourge in ſtore to drive us forward againſt our wills.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore be more zealous in this good work then we have been, let nothing grieve us ſo much as our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in it; as yet, there is no cauſe to feare their diſloyalty, whom many (I hope needleſly) ſuſpect: in ſome things they have ſhowne themſelves more carefull of our Nations honour, then many of its owne Inhabitants: and untill we ſee their generall actions contradict their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vowes, let us not feare to account of them, and call them <hi>Brethren.</hi> If they prove otherwiſe then wee at firſt tooke them for, let us blame our owne backwardneſſe in not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to perfect that which by their aſſiſtance is brought into good forwardneſſe.</p>
